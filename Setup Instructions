Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get **VizPro Max** running on your Raspberry Pi.

### 1. Hardware Requirements
*   **Raspberry Pi:** Model 4B or 5 (4GB+ RAM recommended for smooth YOLO performance).
*   **Camera:** Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 (or compatible CSI camera).
*   **Audio:** USB Microphone and a Speaker (or USB Speakerphone).
*   **Internet:** Active Wi-Fi connection for API calls.

### 2. System Preparation
Ensure your Raspberry Pi OS is up to date. Open a terminal and run:

bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv libatlas-base-dev libportaudio2


*Note: If using a virtual environment (recommended):*
bash
python3 -m venv ruma-env
source ruma-env/bin/activate


### 3. Install Python Dependencies
Install the necessary libraries for vision, audio, and AI.

bash
pip install google-generativeai speechrecognition pyttsx3 opencv-python numpy ultralytics pillow pyaudio

*Note: `picamera2` is typically pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm). If missing, install via apt: `sudo apt install python3-libcamera`.*

### 4. API Configuration
You need a Google Gemini API key to power Ruma's intelligence.
1.  Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  Export it as an environment variable (recommended for security):
    bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
    
    *Or, paste it directly into the `ruma_vision_bot.py` script where it says `API_KEY = "..."`.*

### 5. Running the Robot
Ensure your camera and microphone are connected, then run the script:

bash
python ruma_vision_bot.py


### 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues
*   **ALSA/Audio Errors:** If you see many ALSA warnings, this is common on Linux. As long as the "Listening..." prompt appears, it is working.
*   **Camera Not Detected:** Ensure `libcamera` is enabled in `sudo raspi-config` (under Interfaces) and that you are not running another camera app simultaneously.
*   **Slow Performance:** If the video feed lags, try reducing the resolution in the `picamera2` config line inside the script: `size=(320, 240)`.
