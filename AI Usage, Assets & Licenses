⚖️ AI Usage, Assets & Licenses
Artificial Intelligence Models:

Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite: Utilized via the Google Generative AI SDK as the primary cognitive engine for natural language processing, reasoning, and visual analysis.
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics): Implemented for high-speed, real-time object detection on the edge device (Raspberry Pi).
Datasets:

COCO Dataset: The YOLOv8n model used in this project is pre-trained on the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, allowing it to recognize 80 standard object classes (e.g., person, cup, chair) out of the box.
Third-Party Assets & Libraries:

OpenCV: Used for image processing and frame manipulation.
Picamera2: Official library used for low-level control of the Raspberry Pi Camera Module.
SpeechRecognition: Used as a wrapper to interface with audio input streams.
pyttsx3: Used for offline text-to-speech synthesis.
